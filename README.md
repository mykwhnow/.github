## Our Story
Born from frustration with the intricate electricity market in California, mykwhnow.com was created by JP, a passionate software engineer who turned his own challenges into a solution for others.
Living in San Diego, JP was baffled by his electricity bill. The numbers were overwhelmingly high, the introduction of Community Choice Aggregation (CCA) was perplexing, and the Time-of-Use (TOU) schedules presented their own complexity. With the added factor of solar energy, fully decyphering his electricity bill took him a whole 30 hours!

He knew there had to be a better way.

Harnessing his expertise in software development, JP set out to create a platform that simplifies electricity bills, bringing clarity to what often seems like chaos. 
mykwhnow.com is his personal quest to make a difference for consumers.
